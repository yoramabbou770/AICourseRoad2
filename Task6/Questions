Question: Is the data balanced?
No, there is 1/2 other, 1/4 birds and 1/4 drones.

How many perceptrons should the output layer have?
3, drones, birds and other.

i experimented with the resize of 128x256 and there was 
more complex calculus in the layers of the model and the accuracy was smaller because the kernel need to pass
on all the pixels that are bigger now.
I think that 32x32 and 64x64 are the best resizes to the biggest accuracy, beacause too smaller are not complex to create a good
model and too bigger are too complex.

I experimented other data augmentation like zooming or shearing and other and the ram of the google machine
stopped to work and disconnected because of too many data.

I tried to change the batch size over 32 and gives me smaller accuracy, the epochs to 50 and gives me the same, the learning rate to 0.001 and the model
learn too slowly and 0.1 to quickly, the default of 0.01 is fine.
