- Why is it good to convert images to black and white?
Because the images in RGB are 3 different matrix and take a large place of data on the machine, with 1 image its cool but for deep learning with heavy files its take too much data and the speed activation of the functions is also affected. All depends on the research questions, and for us, the gray level images is enough.

 - How does resizing impact the training of machine learning models?
Resizing the images provide us much data to use because we do not need all the images but just what matters us, the resized images take a little bit of data compared to the originals one, and this have directly impact on the machine.

- Why is it important to have consistent shapes and data types in TensorFlow datasets?
Beacause the libraries like Keras and TensorFlow works with a constant DataSet, constant vector of inputs and if its not in the good shape it may cause problems to the work of the machine.

- How does the choice of activation function impact the model's performance?
Activation functions introduce non linearity to the model and this allow him to do some complex relationships and patterns in the data. In Example I take for the task a sigmoid activation function that is a binary classification model and one consideration is that it can have gradient (SGD) problems in his training.

 - What can be done to improve the model's accuracy?
Change the HyperParameters like number of epochs and the LearningRate, the optimization, mode accuracy, CrossEntropy, add layers or dropout layers of neuron if the machine overfit the data, play with the data and grow up the data, loss function to see what's our goal to reach.
